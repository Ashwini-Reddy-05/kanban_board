# kanban_board
This is a simple Kanban Board web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file creates the structure of the board, including an input field to add new tasks, an add button, and three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done. The CSS file (kanban.css) is used to design the board layout, style the columns and task cards, and make the interface clean and organized. The JavaScript file (kanban.js) adds functionality by allowing users to create tasks, move them between columns, and manage their progress dynamically. This project demonstrates important front-end concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive user interface design in a simple and practical way.
